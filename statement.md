# Problem Statement
Diagnosing medical conditions accurately often requires expert knowledge, which may not always be immediately available to individuals. This project aims to create an interactive system that can suggest possible diseases based on reported symptoms, providing quick guidance before consulting a healthcare professional.

# Scope of the Project
The system is designed to:
- Identify a limited set of common illnesses (flu, cold, COVID-19, migraine) based on user-inputted symptoms.
- Provide a simple interactive interface for symptom collection and diagnosis.
- Serve as a preliminary diagnostic tool and educational resource, not a replacement for professional medical advice.

# Target Users
- General public seeking initial guidance for common illnesses.
- Students or learners interested in expert systems and medical diagnosis automation.
- Healthcare enthusiasts exploring AI/logic-based diagnostic systems.

# High-Level Features
- Rule-based disease diagnosis using Prolog.
- Interactive questioning about symptoms.
- Dynamic symptom storage and evaluation.
- Output of possible disease(s) based on symptom matching.
